This application allows you to easily install a custom Web application, providing files access with [SFTP](https://yunohost.org/en/filezilla).

It can also create a MySQL database - which will be backed up and restored with your application. The connection details will be stored in the file `db_access.txt` located in the root directory.

PHP-FPM version can also be selected among 7.3, 7.4, 8.0, 8.1 and 8.2.

**Once installed, go to the chosen URL to know the user, domain and port you will have to use for the SFTP access.** The password is one you chosen during the installation. Under the Web directory, you will see a `www` folder which contains the public files served by this app. You can put all the files of your custom Web application inside.
